# hauth

Code for the project from the book Practical Web Development in Haskell. The code is accompanied by comments explaining things that weren't clear to me at first glance. While familiar with most of the Haskell concepts presented in the book, I just haven't used Haskell enough to know the common patterns, the libraries and the typeclasses used.

## Usage

The project is using Stack:

* `stack build` Build the project
* `stack exec hauth-exe` Execute the binary created from `build`
* `stack test` Run the tests
